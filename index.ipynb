    "\n",
    "Web applications commonly need to persist application state.\n",
    "Aside from flat files, relational database management systems were historically used in the [Web 1.0](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27960/web-10) era.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the relational model does not easily accommodate semi-structured data, as well as data with hierarchical relationships, leading to the advent of alternatives (traditionally referred to as [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) databases).\n",
    "A [document-oriented database](https://www.mongodb.com/document-databases) (aka \"document database\" or \"document store\") is one category of NoSQL database.\n",
    "Document databases store [documents](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/document/) (analogous to relational database rows/records), which are data structures that resemble Javascript objects.\n",
    "Documents are organized into [collections](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/databases-and-collections/#collections) (analogous to relational database *tables*).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides provide a brief overview of one such document database (MongoDB), and illustrates a few basic essentials for using the mongoose API to interact with MongoDB databases from Node.js applications."
